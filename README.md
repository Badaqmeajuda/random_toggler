OBS Lua script to make one random item inside a scene visible at a time via HOTKEY.

# References
This script was HEAVELY referenced and based on [source toggle](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/source-toggler.860/) from Exeldro.
Another script that helped me a lot was [advanced timer](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/advanced-timer.637/).
